## How to use it

The Angular Development Environment runs on node.js and yarn as a node package manager. If you don't have them installed you can run these commands in your terminal.

Using Homebrew:
``` 
brew install yarn 
```
Using Port:
```
sudo port install yarn
```

Installing Yarn should also install node.js if you don't have it.
